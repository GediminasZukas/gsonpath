Change Log
==========

Version 1.6.3 *(2016-11-09)*
----------------------------

* Fix: Added Java 7 target and source compatibility for all libraries.

Version 1.6.2 *(2016-10-22)*
----------------------------

* Fix: The `equals` method generated for interfaces annotated with `@AutoGsonAdapter` now tests for equality correctly.
* New: Added `toString` method genration for interfaces annotated with `@AutoGsonAdapter`.

Version 1.6.1 *(2016-07-28)*
----------------------------

* Fix: The `FlattenJson` annotation no longer causes the processor to fail when used on interfaces. (Issue [#47](../../issues/47))
* Fix: Interfaces annotated with `@AutoGsonAdapter` now always correctly order their fields (Issue [#45](../../issues/45))
     * When using Json Path notation, if fields with the same parent were not grouped together, the constructor was being called with arguments in the wrong order.

Version 1.6.0 *(2016-07-28)*
----------------------------

* New: Added text substitution support for all fields and methods annotated with the `@SerializedName` annotation.
     * See the [path substitution guide](guides/path_substitution.md) for details.

Version 1.5.3 *(2016-07-28)*
----------------------------

* Fix: The `FlattenJson` annotation may now be used on methods.
     * Since the addition of interface support, it made sense to change this behaviour.

Version 1.5.2 *(2016-07-27)*
----------------------------

* New: Interfaces annotated with `@AutoGsonAdapter` now generate `equals` and `hashCode` implementations within the generated POJO.
     * All fields within the generated POJO are inspected.
          * It is currently not possible to exclude fields from inspection
     * The generated methods are Java 6 compatible as the code does not use the Java 7 `Objects.hash()` method.

Version 1.5.1 *(2016-07-26)*
----------------------------

* Fix: Changed `JsonFieldMissingException` to extend the Gson `JsonParseException` class to more easily prevent possible uncaught exceptions.
* Fix: Interfaces annotated with `@AutoGsonAdapter` now correctly work with inheritance.
* Fix: Interfaces annotated with `@AutoGsonAdapter` are now stricter about their implementation. (See [interfaces guide](guides/interfaces.md) for details surrounding interface design)
     * Methods that do not specify a return type will now fail gracefully.
     * Methods that specify parameters will now fail gracefully.

Version 1.5.0 *(2016-07-03)*
----------------------------

* New: The `@AutoGsonAdapter` annotation can now be used with interfaces.
     * The library generates an immutable POJO which is constructed within the generated Gson `TypeAdapter` class.
     * To learn more about this feature, visit the [interfaces guide](guides/interfaces.md).

Version 1.4.1 *(2016-07-03)*
----------------------------

* Fix: The `VALIDATE_EXPLICIT_NON_NULL` value for the `FieldValidationType` enum now correctly treats primitives as `@NonNull`. This behaviour now matches the documentation.
* Fix: Using an unsupported primitive type within an `@AutoGsonAdapter` annotated class now throws a more informative error. The primitives supported by Gson are: `boolean`, `int`, `long`, `double`.

Version 1.4.0 *(2016-05-26)*
----------------------------

 * New: Made changes to the mandatory field feature to make it more useful. The changes are described below:
     * Removed `@Mandatory` and `@Optional`. Instead the annotation processor will attempt to find any `@Nullable` or `Nonnull` (as well as other permutations such as `NonNull`, `NotNull` and `Notnull`) annotations, and use those instead.
     * The `@AutoGsonAdapter` annotation property `fieldPolicy` has been renamed to `fieldValidationType` to be more clear.
     * The fieldValidationType enum values have the same behaviour as before, however they have been renamed to be clearer as well:
        * NO_VALIDATION - No fields are validated, and the Gson parser should never raise exceptions for missing content.
        * VALIDATE_EXPLICIT_NON_NULL - Any Objects marked with `@NonNull` (or similar), or primitives should fail if the value does not exist within the JSON.
        * VALIDATE_ALL_EXCEPT_NULLABLE - All fields will be treated as `@NonNull`, and should fail when value is not found, unless the field is annotation with `@Nullable` (except for primitives).
 * New: Added a default configuration concept for the `@AutoGsonAdapter` annotation.
     * Allows developers to set default values for the annotation if they are unhappy with the default values provided within the `@AutoGsonAdapter` annotation.
        * Some developers may not like the '.' character being used as a delimiter. With this new feature a developer can change this delimiter throughout the entire application using the default configuration instead of changing every single `@AutoGsonAdapter` annotation.
     * To use this feature, developers must:
        * Annotate a class with the new `@GsonPathDefaultConfiguration` annotation and specify their desired default values
        * Set the `defaultConfiguration` property within the `@AutoGsonAdapter` annotation to point to this class on every usage of `@AutoGsonAdapter` that wishes to use these defaults.
     * See the annotation javadoc for further details.

Version 1.3.0 *(2016-05-14)*
----------------------------

 * New: Added writing support to the generated `TypeAdapter` classes.
    * The `@AutoGsonAdapter` annotation has a new `serializeNulls` property which specifies whether nulls are written to the document. (The same way Gson handles this)
 * New: Added a mandatory field concept which will raise exceptions for missing JSON content
    * Two annotations were added to solve this issue: `@Mandatory` and `@Optional`
        * Since these annotations can be used on primitives, it didn't make sense to use `@Nullable` and `Nonnull` at this stage.
    * The `@AutoGsonAdapter` annotation has a new `fieldPolicy` property which specifies how the generated `TypeAdapter` handles mandatory content. It is an enum with the following values:
        * NEVER_FAIL - No fields are mandatory, and the Gson parser should never raise exceptions for missing content.
        * FAIL_MANDATORY - Any field marked with `@Mandatory` should fail if the value does not exist within the JSON.
        * FAIL_ALL_EXCEPT_OPTIONAL - All fields will be treated as `@Mandatory`, and should fail when content is not found, unless the field is annotation with `@Optional`.
 * Fix: Annotation processor messages are clearer and inform when it has started and completed.
 * Fix: Better error handling for invalid scenarios, such as duplicate JSON field names.
